ABSTRACT="Cost function is an essential part in Application Layer Multicast (ALM)
routing algorithms. It is from a cost function that we can calculate links'
costs and then build the data delivery tree for multicasting.
Unfortunately, cost function remains an almost untouched research area in
ALM routing. In this research, we propose a new multi-variable cost
function considering various end-to-end QoS parameters simultaneously. The
mathematical derivation process is also described in details so that one
can apply it to obtain other multi-variable cost functions according to
their specific requirements. The newly proposed multi-variable cost
function can avoid congestion before it happens, preventing the data
delivery tree from being frequently or unnecessarily changed while still be
adaptable to the dynamic requirements of different applications. With
theoretical analysis, we have proved that the new cost function can provide
better performance for ALM routing algorithms compared to conventional cost
functions."
