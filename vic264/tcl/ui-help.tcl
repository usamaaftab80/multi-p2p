If you see the message ``Waiting for video...'', then no one is transmitting \
video to the conference address you're running on.  Otherwise, you'll \
see a thumbnail sized image and accompanying information for each source. \
Click on the thumbnail to open a larger viewing window.  You can tile the \
thumbnails in multiple columns using the ``Tile'' menu in the ``Menu'' window."

turn off decoding.  It is usually a good idea to do \
this for your own, looped-back transmission."
	helpitem $p "The transmission rate is controlled with the bit-rate \
and frame-rate sliders in the ``Transmission'' panel of the ``Menu'' window.  \
The more restrictive setting limits the transmission rate."
	helpitem $p "The video windows need not be fixed to a given source. \
The ``Mode...'' menu attached to a viewing window allows you to specify \
voice-switched and/or timer-switched modes.   In timer-switched mode, the \
window automatically cycles through (unmuted) sources, while in \
voice-switched mode, the window switches to whomever is talking \
(using cues from vat).  You can have more than one voice-switched window, \
which results in a simple LRU allocation of the windows to most recent \
speakers.  See the man page for more details."
