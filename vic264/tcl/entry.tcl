# For any entry created, the global (array) entryTab($w:action)
# contains the tcl procedure name to invoke when the entry is
# updated (where $w is the wind path of the entry widget).
# This proc is passed two args -- the window and the new value.
# It should return 0 if the edit should be accepted,
# and non-zero otherwise.  entryTab($w:value) should be
# set to the initial value when the widget is created.
