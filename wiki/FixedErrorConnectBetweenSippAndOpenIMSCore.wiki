=Installing SIPp and configuring the Open IMS Core=

   1. download the newest SIPp stable version (http://sipp.sourceforge.net)
   2. compile it with MD5 authentication support
- Add *#include <limits.h>* in the file header where it is missed: *scenario.cpp* and *call.cpp*
   3. install SIPp 
With TLS and authentication  support, you must have installed OpenSSL library (>=0.9.8) (which may come with your system). Building SIPp consist only in adding the "ossl" option to the make command:
   *$gunzip sipp-xxx.tar.gz
   *$tar -xvf sipp-xxx.tar
   *$cd sipp
   *$make ossl

 
 
   4. Modify the scripts for the S-SCSCF (file scscf.cfg)
      set the default authentication algorithm to MD5

      * modparam("scscf","registration_default_algorithm","MD5")*

      set the qop parameter to ""

      modparam("scscf","registration_qop","auth,auth-int") ----->*modparam("scscf","registration_qop","")*
